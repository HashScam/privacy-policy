        <h1>HashScam Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p><strong>Effective Date: </strong>Aug 27, 2024</p>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to HashScam, an AI-powered Facebook Messenger bot designed to help users detect potential fraud and scam situations. Your privacy is of utmost importance to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your information when you interact with HashScam.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>User Information:</strong> HashScam does not collect, store, or share any personal information from users. All interactions with the bot are processed in real time without retaining any identifiable data.</p>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Service (Gemini AI):</strong> HashScam utilizes the Gemini AI API to analyze and detect potential scams and fraudulent activities. While HashScam does not collect data, Gemini AI may process and collect information necessary for its operations. This may include analyzing text data to provide accurate responses and scam detection.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Use of Information</h2>
        <p><strong>Scam Detection:</strong> The primary purpose of HashScam is to assist users in identifying potential fraud and scam situations. The data analyzed by Gemini AI is used solely for this purpose and is not stored or used for any other purpose by HashScam.</p>
        
        <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p><strong>Third-Party Services:</strong> HashScam operates through the Gemini AI API, which processes the information you provide during interactions. Please refer to the <a href="#">Gemini AI Privacy Policy</a> for details on how they handle your information.</p>

        <h2>4. AI Accuracy and Limitations</h2>
        <p><strong>Potential for Errors:</strong> While HashScam is designed to help identify potential scams, it's important to understand that no AI system is perfect. The AI may sometimes make mistakes, provide incorrect information, or fail to identify a scam. Users should always use their judgment and consider seeking additional advice or verification when dealing with potential fraud or scam situations.</p>
        <p><strong>User Responsibility:</strong> HashScam is a tool to assist users, but it should not be the sole resource for decision-making in critical situations. We encourage users to exercise caution and consult with professionals or authorities when in doubt.</p>
        
        <h2>5. Open-Source Project</h2>
        <p><strong>Open-Source Commitment:</strong> HashScam is an open-source project, meaning that its source code is available to the public for review, contribution, and modification. We believe in transparency and collaboration, and we welcome contributions from the community to improve the project. However, as with any open-source software, we advise users to understand that modifications by third parties are not controlled by us and may affect the botâ€™s performance and reliability.</p>
        
        <h2>6. User Control</h2>
        <p><strong>Interaction Data:</strong> Since HashScam does not store any personal information, there is no user data to manage or delete. All interaction data is processed in real time and not retained.</p>
        
        <h2>7. Security</h2>
